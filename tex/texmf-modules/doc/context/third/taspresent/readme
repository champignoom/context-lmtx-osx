Installation
------------

Simply move the module files t-* into a place where TeX can find them. The
canonical location would be $TEXMF/tex/context/third, where you can create a
subdiretory "presentations" to keep everything together. On most systems, you
will have to run texhash after installing new packages. If you want to test the
module before actually installing it, just leave everything in the original
directory and typeset the demo file.


Use
---

A full manual is included, Here is a very short version for the impatient:

To use the module, include this line in your file:

\usemodule[taspresent]
[style=doubleframe,font=Helvetica,size=17pt,stylecolor=blue,stylebottom=sqaure]

For the "style" parameter, there are currently sixteen options:

blackblue
bluegray
bluestripe
darkshade
doubleframe
doubleshade
embossed
graybeams
graysquare
greenblue
horizontalblue
lightblue
narrowstripe
quadblue
rainbowstripe
redframe

This will modify the background of your slides and the placement of certain
elements. 

For the "font" parameter, there are currently five options:

LatinModern     [typesets in LatinModern Serif]
LatinModernSans [typesets in LatinModern Sans]
Times           [the free clone of TimesNew Roman]
Helvetica       [the free clone of Helvetica]
Pagella         [the tex-gyre clone of Palatino; only if you have the tex-gyre 
                fonts installed]
User            [this does not set a font; provide your own definitions]

If you want to use your own typescripts, remember to use the bodyfont at
\Normalsize like so:

\usetypescriptfile[type-mytypescript]
\usetypescript[myfont][ec]
\setupbodyfont[MyFont,\Normalsize]

And of course, invoke the typescript after the \usemodule part!

The "size" can be set to 16pt, 17pt, 18pt, 19pt, 20pt, or 21pt ; the default is
17pt for text and 27pt for titles.

The easiest way to see what the module does and which macros it provides is
looking at (and typesetting) the included file "demo.tex" with different
options. If you want to know more about the way in which the module is set up,
typeset the source of the different source files with the command texmfstart
texexec --module. The source is annotated, so you should be able to see how it
works even if you don't have too much experience with ConTeXt.

Defining your own styles is easy: have a look at the style files which are
included. Certain macros have to be defined. Roll your own definitions for
these macros and for the background, write them into a file whatever.tex and
use this new style by setting it as the value to the "style" key like so:
\usemodule[taspresent][font=Times,size=17pt,style=whatever]
